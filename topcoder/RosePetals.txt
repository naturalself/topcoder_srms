"Petals Around the Rose" is a pretty well known logic game.  A person who knows the game rolls five dice and then says a number.  The other players must guess the rule used to obtain that number.  We will not ask you to play this game because it's a tricky one.  We will simply tell you that the rule is to sum the number of dots that are around the center dot of each die, like the petals around a rose. If a die has no dot in the center, it has no petals. The face of the die labeled with 1 dot has 0 petals, the face with 2 dots has 0 petals, the face with 3 dots has 2 petals, the face with 4 dots has 0 petals, the face with 5 dots has 4 petals and finally the face with 6 dots has 0 petals as can be seen in the picture.





You are given a vector <int> dice containing the values of the five dice. Return the total number of petals in this configuration.


DEFINITION
Class:RosePetals
Method:getScore
Parameters:vector <int>
Returns:int
Method signature:int getScore(vector <int> dice)


CONSTRAINTS
-dice will contain exactly 5 elements.
-Each element of dice will be between 1 and 6, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{1, 2, 3, 2, 1}

Returns: 2

In this case we have 0 petals for 1 as there are no dots around the central dot, 0 petals for 2 as it has no central dot, 2 petals for 3, 0 petals for 2 and 0 petals for 1.

1)
{4, 4, 5, 6, 5}

Returns: 8

In this case we have 0 petals + 0 petals + 4 petals + 0 petals + 4 petals = 8 petals.

2)
{1, 2, 3, 3, 5}

Returns: 8



3)
{3, 3, 3, 3, 3}

Returns: 10



4)
{2, 2, 2, 2, 2}

Returns: 0
