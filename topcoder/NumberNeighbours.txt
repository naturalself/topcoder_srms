PROBLEM STATEMENT

The celebrated general Archibald Waving took charge of the second army in the occidental front. 
After losing the first army, Waving has become obsessed with effective organization of the army. 
As a part of this endeavor he has assigned numbers to each of his soldiers. He has also devised a rule 
which allows two soldiers to work together if and only if the numbers assigned to the soldiers are 
neighbouring numbers. 

Two numbers x and y are neighbouring numbers if there exists a permutation of digits 
of x and a permutation of digits of y such that they are equal if we ignore the leading 
zeros in the permutations.

For example, the numbers 40020 and 204 are neighboring. To see this, permute the digits of 40020 to achieve 
00042 and the digits of 204 to achieve 042. If you ignore the leading zeros, both numbers become equal to 42, 
so they are neighboring.



You are given a vector <int> numbers representing soldiers' numbers. Waving needs 
to pick two soldiers to send a telegram. He would like to know how many different pairs of soldiers are 
there who can work together to accomplish the task. 

Help Waving by returning the number of pairs of neighbouring numbers in the vector <int> numbers.

EXAMPLES

0)
{10, 1, 100, 20, 2, 3}

Returns: 4

The pairs of neighbouring numbers are (10, 1), (1, 100), (20, 2) and (10, 100).

1)
{204, 42, 40020, 200}

(204,42),(204,40020),(42,40020)

Returns: 3

2)
{1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000}

Returns: 21

Any two numbers are neighbouring.

3)
{3, 33, 333, 3333}

Returns: 0

There are no two numbers that are neighbouring.

4)
{1024, 4021, 204, 303, 33, 603, 36, 55, 505}

Returns: 4
