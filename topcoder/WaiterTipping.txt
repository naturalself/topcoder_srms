PROBLEM STATEMENT
You have just finished eating your Chinese food, and the waiter has brought you the bill.
You note the untaxed total on the bill, given as an int in total.
Additionally, you know the tax rate in your locale, given as an int in taxPercent.
Lastly, you have counted how much money you have, given as an int in money.

Since you feel the service was excellent, you want to give as large a tip as you can afford. You are to return the largest integral value of tip such that: 
total + floor(total*taxPercent/100) + floor(total*tip/100) <= money 
If there is no non-negative value of tip that satisfies the above inequality, return -1 (you don't have enough money to pay the bill and tax).

600

Returns: 10

Here, you pay 500 for the bill and 50 for tax, leaving you 50 for the tip, which is 10% of the original bill total.

Returns: 10

Similar to above, but here you have 54 cents for tip, but this will still only get you 10%.

Uh-oh, looks like you don't have enough money!

Returns: 111

226 + floor(226*48/100) + floor(226*111/100) =
226 + floor(10848/100) + floor(25086/100) = 
226 + 108 + 250 =
584

696

Returns: 415

123 + floor(123*52/100) + floor(123*415/100) =
123 + floor(6396/100) + floor(51045/100) = 
123 + 63 + 510 = 
696
