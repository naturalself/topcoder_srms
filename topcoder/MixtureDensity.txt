PROBLEM STATEMENT
A pharmacist is making a mixture of several ingredients. She needs to know the density of the resulting mixture. Density is defined as the mass of the mixture divided by its volume.

You're given a vector <string> ingredients, each element of which describes a single ingredient and is formatted "<Volume> ml of <Name>, weighing <Mass> g" (quotes for clarity). <Volume> and <Mass> are integers representing the volume in milliliters and mass in grams, respectively.  <Name> is the name of the ingredient.

Return the density of the resulting mixture in grams per milliliters.

DEFINITION
Class:MixtureDensity
Method:getDensity
Parameters:vector <string>
Returns:double
Method signature:double getDensity(vector <string> ingredients)


NOTES
-The returned value must be accurate to within a relative or absolute value of 1E-9.


CONSTRAINTS
-ingredients will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of ingredients will contain between 23 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-Each element of ingredients will be formatted as described in the statement.
-Each <Volume> in ingredients will be an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, with no leading zeroes.
-Each <Mass> in ingredients will be an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, with no leading zeroes.
-Each <Name> in ingredients will contain only lowercase letters ('a'-'z') and spaces (' ').
-Each <Name> in ingredients will begin and end with a lowercase letter.


EXAMPLES

0)
{"200 ml of oil, weighing 180 g"}

Returns: 0.9

The density is mass/volume = 180g/200ml = 0.9g/ml, the answer is 0.9.

1)
{"100 ml of dichloromethane, weighing 130 g", "100 ml of sea water, weighing 103 g"}

Returns: 1.165

The volume of the resulting mixture is 200 ml and the mass is 233 g. Therefore, the density is 233g/200ml = 1.165g/ml.

2)
{"1000 ml of water, weighing 1000 g", "500 ml of orange juice concentrate, weighing 566 g"}

Returns: 1.044



3)
{"1000 ml of something   l i g h t, weighing 1 g"}

Returns: 0.0010
