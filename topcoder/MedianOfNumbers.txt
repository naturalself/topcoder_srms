PROBLEM STATEMENT
In a set of distinct numbers, the median is an element M such that the number of elements greater than M is equal to the number of elements smaller than M. For example, in a set {1, 4, 2, 5, 7} the median is 4 because two elements (5 and 7) are greater than 4 and 2 elements (1 and 2) smaller than 4. The set {1, 5, 8, 3} has no median because no element from it satisfies the definition above.
You are given a vector <int> numbers. Return the median of numbers or -1 if numbers has no median.

EXAMPLES

0)
{1, 4, 2, 5, 7}

Returns: 4

The example from the statement.

1)
{1, 5, 8, 3}

Returns: -1

2)
{7}

Returns: 7

There are zero elements that are greater than 7 and zero elements that are smaller than 7. 

3)
{7, 12}

Returns: -1

4)
{66, 53, 47, 86, 18, 21, 97, 92, 15}

Returns: 53

5)
{32, 54, 27, 4, 69, 96, 73, 1, 100, 15, 21}

Returns: 32
