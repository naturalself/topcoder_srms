PROBLEM STATEMENT

You want to split some people into two teams to play a game.
In order to make the split, you first designate two
team captains who take alternate turns selecting players for their teams.
During each turn, the captain selects a single player for his team.
Since each captain wants to make the strongest possible team, he will
always select the best available player.
The players have strengths, which are given in the vector <int>
strengths, where higher numbers indicate better players. After all
the players have been selected, the team strength
is computed as the sum of the strengths of the players on that team.



For example, if strengths={5,7,8,4,2}, then the first captain selects
the player with strength 8 for his team, the second captain gets the player
with strength 7, the first gets the one with strength 5, the second the
one with strength 4, and the last one (strength 2) goes to the first team.
The first team now has a total strength 8+5+2=15, and the second team has
strength 7+4=11.



Return the absolute strength difference between the two teams. For the
example above you should return 4 (=15-11).

{5,7,8,4,2}

Returns: 4

The example from the problem statement.

1)

Returns: 0

Both teams with equal strength.
