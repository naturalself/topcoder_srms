PROBLEM STATEMENT
A skew symmetric matrix M satisfies MT = -M, where MT denotes the transpose of the matrix M and -M denotes the matrix obtained by multiplying each entry of M by -1. The transpose of a matrix M is obtained by replacing the element in the i'th row and j'th column of M with the element in the j'th row and i'th column of M. Note that this requires the diagonal elements of a skew-symmetric matrix to be equal to 0.
Create a class SkewSymmetric which contains a method minChanges. The method will take a vector <string> M, each element of which is a single space separated list of integers. The j'th number in the i'th element of M represents the value at row i and column j of the matrix. The method should return the minimum number of values in M that must be changed such that the resulting matrix is skew symmetric.

DEFINITION
Class:SkewSymmetric
Method:minChanges
Parameters:vector <string>
Returns:int
Method signature:int minChanges(vector <string> M)


CONSTRAINTS
-M will contain between 2 and 10 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of M will be a single space separated list of exactly n integers, where n is the number of elements in M.
-Each element of M will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-Each integer in M will be between -99 and 99 inclusive, with no extra leading zeros.
-The integer zero will be represented as '0' (quotes for clarity) only, and not '-0' (quotes for clarity) in M.


EXAMPLES

0)
{"1 2 8", "-2 1 0", "3 99 3"}

Returns: 5

One possible skew-symmetric matrix obtained by changing 5 elements in M is:

  0  2  -3
 -2  0 -99
  3 99   0

Note that the diagonal elements must be 0.
