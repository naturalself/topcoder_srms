PROBLEM STATEMENT
An acronym is a sequence of characters that is used to refer to something with a very long name. An acronym is generated from a long name by capitalizing the first letter of every word in the name and concatenating them together. There are three exceptions: the common words "and", "the", and "of" are ignored when generating the acronym. In this problem, a word is defined as one or more non-space characters preceded by either a space or the beginning of the string and followed by either a space or the end of the string. Write a class VLNString with a method makeAcronym that takes a string longName and returns a string with its acronym generated as described above.
