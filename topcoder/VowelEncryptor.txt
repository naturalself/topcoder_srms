You are given a vector <string> text, each element of which contains a single word.  Encrypt the text by removing 
all vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') from every word that contains at least one non-vowel.  If a word consists only of vowels, leave it as is.  Return the result as a vector <string>, where the ith element is the encrypted version of the ith element in text.
