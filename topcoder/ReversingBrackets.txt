PROBLEM STATEMENT

There is an unsafe way to write encrypted messages that works as follows.  At most one contiguous substring of the original string is reversed and enclosed in square brackets.  For example, the encrypted string "he[row oll]ld" represents the string "hello world".  You will be given s, a string encrypted with this method, and you must return the original unencrypted string.
