PROBLEM STATEMENT
When selling goods, it is important to know exactly how much it costs to acquire each item.  A number of distributed costs, such as marketing often make this difficult, but not impossible.  If a business can figure out how much an item costs, with some accuracy, then it can easily calculate the profit margins for the item.  This information, combined with sales figures, can be used to determine which items are the most important to a business.  In this problem you will be given the costs, prices, and number of sales for a number of items.  Each element of costs represents the total costs accrued from selling a single item.  The corresponding elements (ones with the same index) of prices and sales represent the prices at which single items are sold, and the number of sales of each item that have occurred in some time period, respectively.  You are to return the name of the item (the corresponding element of items) that provides the business with the most profits.  If there is a tie for the most profitable item, return the one that comes earliest in items (lowest index).  If no item provides the business with positive profits you should return the empty string.

{100,120,150,1000}
{110,110,200,2000}
{20,100,50,3}
{"Video Card","256M Mem","CPU/Mobo combo","Complete machine"}

Returns: "Complete machine"

This business makes 200 on video cards, loses 1000 on memory, makes 2500 on CPU/Mobo combos, and makes 3000 on complete machines.  Since 3000 is the highest, you should return "Complete machine".
