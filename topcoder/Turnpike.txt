PROBLEM STATEMENT
The turnpike has mile markers at each mile along its length, with 0 at the western end
and pikeLength at the eastern end (so it is exactly pikeLength miles long). 
We locate our service
plazas at various mile markers. Each plaza
can service traffic going in either direction, so we never place multiple 
plazas at the same mile marker. We also never place a plaza at either end of 
the turnpike. 

The locations of all the existing plazas are given in a vector <int> plazas. We are
interested in locating n new plazas along the turnpike in such a way as to
minimize the longest segment of turnpike that has no plaza. Given pikeLength, n, 
and plazas, determine the best locations for the n new plazas and return the length of the
longest unserviced segment after the new plazas have been added.



DEFINITION
Class:Turnpike
Method:unserviced
Parameters:int, int, vector <int>
Returns:int
Method signature:int unserviced(int pikeLength, int n, vector <int> plazas)


CONSTRAINTS
-pikeLength will be between 100 and 1000, inclusive.
-n will be between 1 and 100, inclusive.
-plazas will contain between 0 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-The elements in plazas will be distinct values between 1 and pikeLength-1, inclusive.
-n plus the number of elements in plazas will be less than pikeLength.

{300,701,800}

Returns: 300



   The new plaza should be placed in the segment between 300 and 701. But the best
   we can do is to make the longest unserviced segment be of length 300, since the
   segment from 0 to 300 will still be unserviced.

{200,701,800}

Returns: 251



   We should place the new plaza in the segment between 200 and 701. We can reduce
   the longest unserviced segment to 251 by placing it either at 450 or at 451.

Returns: 70

The seven new plazas can be distributed along the turnpike so
that the longest unserviced segments are from 201 to a new
plaza at 271, from 271 to 341 (also a new plaza), and from
341 to the existing plaza at 411.
