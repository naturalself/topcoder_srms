PROBLEM STATEMENT



You are helping to develop a weblog-management system called
bloggo. Although bloggo pushes all content to the front end of a
website in HTML, not all content authors enjoy using HTML tags in their
text. To make their lives easier, bloggo offers a simple syntax called
shortcuts to achieve some HTML textual effects. Your job is to
take a document written with shortcuts and translate it into proper HTML.




One shortcut is used to make italicized text. HTML does this with
the  and </igs, but in bloggo, an author can simply
enclose a piece of text using two instances of the underscore character,
'_'. Thus, where a content author writes




  You _should_ see the baby elephant at the zoo!



bloggo will publish the following instead.




  You should</ie the baby elephant at the zoo!



Another shortcut serves to render text in boldface, which HTML
accomplishes with  and </bgs. Bloggo lets content
authors do the same with paired instances of the asterisk character,
'*'. When a content author writes the text




  Move it from *Receiving* to *Accounts Payable*.



it will end up on the website as




  Move it from Receiving</b Accounts Payable</b

Given a string, text, containing zero or more usages
of the italic and boldface shortcuts, translate it into HTML
as demonstrated by the examples above. There will be an even number
of underscores and of asterisks in text, respectively, and the
spans of text enclosed by successive pairs of these characters will not
overlap. To render a span of text in italics in HTML, you must start
with the  tag and end with the </ig. For boldface
text, start with  and end with </bfter rendering all
shortcuts in HTML, return the resulting text as a string.
