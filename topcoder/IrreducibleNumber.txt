PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are given a vector <int> A. An integer K is irreducible with respect to A if K cannot be represented as a sum of one or more elements from A, where each element of A may be used at most once.  Return the smallest positive integer that is irreducible with respect to A.

DEFINITION
Class:IrreducibleNumber
Method:getIrreducible
Parameters:vector <int>
Returns:int
