PROBLEM STATEMENT
In the English language, the plural form of a noun is created according to many difficult rules, but for the most part, a noun can be transformed into its plural form using four simple rules. These rules are: 


If the word ends in 's', 'z', 'x', 'ch' or 'sh', add 'es' to the end of the word;


If the word ends in 'ay', 'ey', 'iy', 'oy' or 'uy', add 's' to the end of the word;


If the word ends in 'y', but doesn't satisfy the previous rule, replace the trailing 'y' with 'ies';


In all other cases, just add 's' to the end of the word.





You will be given a vector <string> nouns. Transform each element of nouns into its plural form using the rules above and return the resulting vector <string>.
