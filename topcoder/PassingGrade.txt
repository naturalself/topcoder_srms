PROBLEM STATEMENT

You are studying for the final exam in a tough course, and want to know how many points you need to score on the final to pass the course.  
You know how many points you earned on each assignment (pointsEarned), how many points were possible on each assignment (pointsPossible), and how many points are possible on the final exam (finalExam).
You need to earn a minimum of 65% of the total possible points to pass the course.
Assume your score on the final exam will be an integral number of points between 0 and finalExam, inclusive.
Return the number of points you need to score on the final to pass the course,
or -1 if it is impossible for you to pass the course.

EXAMPLES

0)
{55,77,82,60}
{100,100,100,100}
300

Returns: 181

If you score 181 points on the final, then you will finish the course with exactly 65% of the possible points.

1)
{ 1, 2, 3, 4 }
{ 2, 3, 4, 5 }
7

Returns: 4

If you score 4 points on the final, then you pass with 66.7% of the
total possible points, but if you score 3 points on the final, then
you fail with 61.9% of the possible points.

2)
{ 1, 2, 2, 1 }
{ 9, 9, 9, 9 }
9

Returns: -1

Even if you score 9 points on the final, you still fail with 33.3% of the possible points.
