PROBLEM STATEMENT
You have a list of rectangles divided into groups. The index of a group is the sum of the areas of all the rectangles in the group. You are to determine the group with the biggest index.
You are given a vector <string> rectangles. Each element of rectangles represents a single rectangle, and is formatted as "G L W", where G is the name of the group to which the rectangle belongs, L is the rectangle's length, and W is the rectangle's width. Return a string formatted as "G I", where G is the name of the group with the maximal index, and I is the index of that group with no leading zeroes. If there are multiple groups with the same maximal index, return the one whose name comes first alphabetically.

DEFINITION
Class:RectangleGroups
Method:maximalIndexed
Parameters:vector <string>
Returns:string
Method signature:string maximalIndexed(vector <string> rectangles)


CONSTRAINTS
-rectangles will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of rectangles will be formatted as "G L W", where G is an uppercase letter ('A' - 'Z') and L and W are integers with no leading zeroes.
-Each L and W will be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{"A 1 2", "A 3 3"}

Returns: "A 11"

There is only one group, and its index is 11 (1*2 + 3*3).

1)
{"A 1 2", "B 3 3", "A 2 1"}

Returns: "B 9"

The index of A is 4, and the index of B is 9.

2)
{"D 1 6", "F 2 3", "G 1 1", "G 5 1", "C 3 2"}

Returns: "C 6"

All groups have the same index, and C comes first alphabetically.

3)
{"S 2 54", "Y 34 65", "F 234 23", "D 84 127", "R 603 46",
"S 36 192", "Y 76 32", "T 54 28", "S 22 22"}

Returns: "R 27738"
