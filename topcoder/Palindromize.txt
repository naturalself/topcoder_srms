PROBLEM STATEMENT

A palindrome is a string that reads the same from left to right as it does from right to left.  Given a string s, return the shortest palindrome that can be produced by adding zero or more characters to the right end of s.  There is always one unique answer.


DEFINITION
Class:Palindromize
Method:minAdds
Parameters:string
Returns:string
Method signature:string minAdds(string s)


CONSTRAINTS
-s will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-Each character of s will be a lowercase letter ('a'-'z').


EXAMPLES

0)
"add"

Returns: "adda"

Add 'a' to make a palindrome. "adddda" is also a valid palindrome, but it is not the shortest possible one.

1)
"cigartragic"

Returns: "cigartragic"

This is already a palindrome, so the shortest solution is to add 0 letters.

2)
"redocpot"

Returns: "redocpotopcoder"



3)
"acaba"

Returns: "acabaca"



4)
"abczyxyz"
