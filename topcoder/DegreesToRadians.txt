PROBLEM STATEMENT

In some forms of geometry, like the kind used in geographical longitude/latitude measurements, angles are measured in base-60.  The base unit is the degree.  One degree contains 60 minutes, and one minute contains 60 seconds.


You will be given the measurement of an angle in degrees, minutes, and seconds.  Return the given angle in radians.  Note that n degrees is equal to  n*PI/180 radians.


DEFINITION
Class:DegreesToRadians
Method:convertToRadians
Parameters:int, int, int
Returns:double
Method signature:double convertToRadians(int degrees, int minutes, int seconds)


NOTES
-The return value must have an absolute or relative error less than 1e-9.


CONSTRAINTS
-degrees will be between 0 and 359, inclusive.
-minutes will be between 0 and 59, inclusive.
-seconds will be between 0 and 59, inclusive.
