PROBLEM STATEMENT
A string is considered to be a composite of several maximal segments of identical characters. For example, "aaabbaaac" is a composite of the segments: "aaa", "bb", "aaa" and "c". Given a string, return the average length of all the segments which form that string.


DEFINITION
Class:StringSegment
Method:average
Parameters:string
Returns:double
Method signature:double average(string s)


NOTES
-A return value with either an absolute or relative error of less than 1.0E-9 is considered correct.


CONSTRAINTS

0)
"aaabbaaac"

Returns: 2.25
