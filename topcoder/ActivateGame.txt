PROBLEM STATEMENT
ActivateGame is played on a rectangular grid with N rows and M columns. The rows are numbered 0 to N-1 from top to bottom, and the columns are numbered 0 to M-1 from left to right. A number is assigned to each cell.


The game is played as follows. Initially, only the top-left cell (row 0, column 0) is activated, and your score is zero. Then, on each turn, you choose one activated cell and one non-activated cell which is vertically or horizontally adjacent to that cell. The absolute difference between the numbers assigned to those two cells is added to your score, and the non-activated cell becomes activated. This is repeated until all the cells have been activated.


You are given a vector <string> grid. The j-th character of the i-th element of grid represents the number assigned to the cell at row i, column j. Characters are mapped to numbers as follows:

'0' - '9' corresponds to 0 - 9
'a' - 'z' corresponds to 10 - 35
'A' - 'Z' corresponds to 36 - 61

Return the maximum possible score you can achieve.

EXAMPLES

0)
{"05",
 "aB"}

Returns: 69

Initially only the cell containing '0' is activated. Use the following sequence of moves to maximize your score:

Choose the activated cell containing '0' and the adjacent non-activated cell containing 'a' (which represents the number 10). Their absolute difference, 10, is added to your score, and the cell containing 'a' becomes activated.
Choose the activated cell containing 'a' and the adjacent non-activated cell containing 'B' (which represents the number 37). Their absolute difference is 27.
Choose the activated cell containing 'B' and the adjacent non-activated cell containing '5' (which represents the number 5). Their absolute difference is 32.

Your total score is 10 + 27 + 32 = 69.
