PROBLEM STATEMENT
You are developing a new software calculator. During the testing phase of the software you have found that the test cases use different symbols as the decimal point of 
floating numbers. Moreover some test cases contain useless space symbols. Now you want to
bring the numbers to a unified format.
You will be given a vector <string> numbers. Remove all space symbols (ASCII code 32) from the given numbers and 
replace each non-digit symbol with a dot symbol ('.'). You should not make any other changes to the numbers.
