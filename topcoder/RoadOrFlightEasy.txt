PROBLEM STATEMENT
The king has been out to work for a long time and he wants to go back to his queen as fast as possible. The king is in city 0 and the queen is in city N. There are roads and flights connecting city i to city (i+1) for all i between 0 and N-1, inclusive. 

You are given vector <int> roadTime whose i-th element is the time it takes to travel from city i to city (i+1) by road and vector <int> flightTime whose i-th element is the time it takes to travel from city i to city (i+1) by flight. However, taking a flight risks the life of the king due to the technological limitations in the kingdom. Hence the queen has asked the king to take at most K flights on his way.

Return the minimum amount of time in which the king can reach his queen.

DEFINITION
Class:RoadOrFlightEasy
Method:minTime
Parameters:int, vector <int>, vector <int>, int
Returns:int
Method signature:int minTime(int N, vector <int> roadTime, vector <int> flightTime, int K)


CONSTRAINTS
-N will be between 1 and 50, inclusive.
-roadTime will contain exactly N elements.
-flightTime will contain exactly N elements.
-Each element of roadTime and flightTime will be between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
-K will be between 0 and N, inclusive.

All flightTimes here are less than roadTimes. However the king can choose only 1 flight. The are two possible optimal routes. City 0-->1, 1-->2 by road and 2-->3 by flight takes time 4 + 6 + 3 = 13 units. City 0-->1 by road, 1-->2 by flight and 2-->3 by road also takes time 4 + 2 + 7 = 13 units.

Now the king is allowed to take 2 flights.

Choose all 3 flights since flights are faster than roads.

flightTime can be larger than roadTime. So the King may take fewer than K flights even though he is allowed to take K of them.
