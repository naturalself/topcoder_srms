PROBLEM STATEMENT

The inchworm is a creature of regular habits. She inches forward some distance along the branch of a tree, then stops to rest. If she has stopped at a leaf, she makes a meal of it. Then she inches forward the same distance as before, and repeats this routine until she has reached or passed the end of the branch.


Consider an inchworm traveling the length of a branch whose leaves are spaced at uniform intervals. Depending on the distance between her resting points, the inchworm may or may not be able to eat all of the leaves. There is always a leaf at the beginning of the branch, which is where the inchworm rests before setting out on her journey.


You are given three int values that specify, in inches: the length of the branch; the distance traveled by the inchworm between rests; and the distance between each consecutive pair of leaves. Given that the inchworm only eats at rest, calculate the number of leaves she will consume.


DEFINITION
Class:Inchworm
Method:lunchtime
Parameters:int, int, int
Returns:int
Method signature:int lunchtime(int branch, int rest, int leaf)


NOTES
-The inchworm starts by gobbling up the leaf at the beginning of the branch.
-If there is a leaf at the end of the branch, the inchworm eats it only if it falls at a resting point.


CONSTRAINTS
-branch is between 1 and 1000000 (one million), inclusive
-rest is between 1 and 1000, inclusive
-leaf is between 1 and 1000, inclusive
