PROBLEM STATEMENT



A full-sized golf course consists of 18 lawns known as holes. The player's
objective is to strike a ball with his club in such a way that it travels
from a specified point at one end of the lawn to a specified point at
the other, and to do so with as few strokes as he can. Associated with
each hole is a positive number, the par, which is the number of strokes
it is expected to take a competent golfer to complete the hole.



A player's performance on an individual hole is described by
a phrase that depends on the number of strokes he took relative to
par. To make a "bogey", for example, means that the player has completed
a hole in one stroke more than the par value, and a "double bogey" is
two strokes over par. Two strokes under par, on the other hand, is an
"eagle", while the "albatross", a rare bird indeed, is three strokes
under par. The following is a complete dictionary of scoring phrases.




    
    "triple bogey"  three strokes over par
    "double bogey"  two strokes over par
    "bogey"         one stroke over par
    "par"           exactly par 
    "birdie"        one stroke under par
    "eagle"         two strokes under par
    "albatross"     three strokes under par
    "hole in one"   exactly one stroke


 

The managers of Gravel Mountain Golf Course have contracted you to
implement a score-management system that will translate a single player's
scores from the above jargon to a numerical total. You are given a
vector <int> specifying the par value of each of the course's
18 holes in playing order. You are also given a vector <string>
such that the nth string describes the player's
score on the nth hole.  The reported scores will be valid
and complete. Compute the player's total score and return it as an
int.
