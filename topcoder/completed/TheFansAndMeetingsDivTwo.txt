PROBLEM STATEMENT

John and Brus have become very famous people all over the world, especially in Bolivia.
Stories written about them by a Bolivian man have become very popular in that country.
John and Brus have decided to visit their fans in Bolivia, but unfortunately, they only have time to visit one city each.



John will randomly choose one city.
Each city has the same probability of being chosen.
If he chooses the i-th city, he will meet between minJ[i] and maxJ[i] fans, inclusive.
Each possible number of fans is equally likely.
Brus will go through the exact same process, but in his case, the number of fans he would meet in the i-th city is between minB[i] and maxB[i], inclusive.
Note that John and Brus are not required to visit different cities.
Return the probability that John and Brus will each meet the same number of fans.
