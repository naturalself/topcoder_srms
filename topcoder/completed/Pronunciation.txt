PROBLEM STATEMENT
Peter has problems with pronouncing difficult words. In particular he can't pronounce words that contain three or more consecutive consonants (such as "street" or "first"). Furthermore he can't pronounce words that contain two or more consecutive vowels that are different (such as "goal" or "beauty"). He can pronounce words with two consecutive equal vowels though  (such as "need").
