PROBLEM STATEMENT
You will be given a vector <string> input.  The value of each character in input is computed as follows:
   Value = (Alphabet Position) + (Element of input) + (Position in Element) 

All positions are 0-based.  'A' has alphabet position 0, 'B' has alphabet position 1, ... The returned hash is the sum of all character values in input. 
For example, if 
input = {"CBA",
         "DDD"}
then each character value would be computed as follows: 
2 =   2 + 0 + 0   :  'C' in element 0 position 0
2 =   1 + 0 + 1   :  'B' in element 0 position 1
2 =   0 + 0 + 2   :  'A' in element 0 position 2
4  =  3 + 1 + 0   :  'D' in element 1 position 0
5  =  3 + 1 + 1   :  'D' in element 1 position 1
6  =  3 + 1 + 2   :  'D' in element 1 position 2
 The final hash would be 2+2+2+4+5+6 = 21.
