PROBLEM STATEMENT
The TopCoder office building is filled with very efficient people.
Each of these people always parks their car in the closest
(to the building) available parking space. The parking spaces
are arranged linearly, with space number one being the closest
to the building, space number two being the second closest to
the building, etc.

Given a sequence of employee arrivals and departures, determine
the number of parking spaces used that day. The parking
lot is empty at the beginning of the day. Names are case
sensitive.

For example in the sequence of events below:
{"Alice arrives",
 "bob arrives",
 "Alice departs",
 "Charles arrives",
 "bob departs",
 "Charles departs"}

Alice parks in space 1
bob parks in space 2
Alice vacates space 1
Charles parks in space 1
bob vacates space 2
Charles vacates space 1

The total number of parking spaces used is 2.



DEFINITION
Class:OfficeParking
Method:spacesUsed
Parameters:vector <string>
Returns:int
Method signature:int spacesUsed(vector <string> events)


NOTES
-HINT: If the maximum number of people at the office building at once is N, then there is never a reason for anyone to park in the (N+1)st spot, as one of the first N spots must have been available when they arrived.


CONSTRAINTS
-events will have between 0 and 50 elements inclusive.
-Each element of events must contain between 9 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-Each element of events is formatted as "<name> <action>" (quotes for clarity).
-Each <name> contains between 1 and 42 characters, inclusive.
-Each <name> contains only letters ('a'-'z', 'A'-'Z').
-Each <name> and <action> are separated by exactly one space character.
-Each <action> is either "arrives" or "departs".
-Departures will always have a matching arrival (with the exact same case sensitive name) in a previous element of events.
-There will not be two arrivals of the exact same case sensitive name without an intervening departure of the exact same name.
