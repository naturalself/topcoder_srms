PROBLEM STATEMENT
A simple calculator accepts the following kinds of strings as input:

	 1) NUM+NUM 
	 2) NUM-NUM 
	 3) NUM*NUM 
	 4) NUM/NUM 	

where NUM is a positive integer, between 1 and 10000 inclusive that can contain leading zeros.  Return the value produced by the given expression.  Here +,-,*, and / denote addition, subtraction, multiplication and division respectively.  All operations are done on integers, so "5/3" returns 1.

DEFINITION
Class:SimpleCalculator
Method:calculate
Parameters:string
Returns:int
Method signature:int calculate(string input)


CONSTRAINTS
-input will contain between 3 and 50 characters inclusive.
-input will have the form <NUM><OP><NUM> where<NUM> is a positive integer between 1 and 10000 inclusive, that may contain leading zeros and <OP> is one of (quotes for clarity) '+','*','-', or '/'.
-input will not contain any spaces.


EXAMPLES

0)
"5/3"

Returns: 1

Remember integer division is used, so results are truncated.

1)
"15*3"

Returns: 45

2)
"1-10000"

Returns: -9999

Negative results are allowed.

3)
"17+18"

Returns: 35

4)
"0000000000000018/00000000000000000009"

Returns: 2
