PROBLEM STATEMENT
The king is trying to find new ways to generate revenue, and he is currently exploring tourism as one potential avenue. The kingdom is a group of islands, and the amount of revenue that can be generated depends on the combined total length of beaches on all the islands.

You are given a vector <string> kingdom consisting of '.' or '#' characters. '#' represents a land mass, whereas '.' represents water. kingdom[i][j] represents a regular-hexagon shaped area with each side of unit length. Since the cells are hexagonal in shape, the odd-numbered rows (0-based) are 'shifted' towards the right. A beach is a segment which has water on one side, and land on the other.
An example vector <string> and the corresponding image are given below to illustrate. The beaches are marked in red.

{"..#.##",
 ".##.#.",
 "#.#..."}



Return the combined total length of beaches on all the islands.
