PROBLEM STATEMENT
In soccer leagues, the winner of a match is awarded with 3 points and the loser 0 points. In case of a tie, both teams are awarded with 1 point each.

Create a class Soccer containing the method maxPoints which takes a vector <int> wins, the number of wins for each team in the league, and a vector <int> ties, the number of ties for each team in the league and returns an int, the maximum points a team in the league has. The
i'th elements of wins and ties correspond to the number of wins and ties respectively for team i.

DEFINITION
Class:Soccer
Method:maxPoints
Parameters:vector <int>, vector <int>
Returns:int
Method signature:int maxPoints(vector <int> wins, vector <int> ties)


NOTES
-Two or more teams may have the same number of points.


CONSTRAINTS
-wins will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-ties will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-wins will contain the same number of elements as ties.
-Each element in wins will be between 0 and 100, inclusive.
-Each element in ties will be between 0 and 100, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{1,4,3,0,0}
{3,1,5,3,1}

Returns: 14

The number of points for each team are:

Team 0: 3*1 + 1*3 = 6 points
Team 1: 3*4 + 1*1 = 13 points
Team 2: 3*3 + 1*5 = 14 points
Team 3: 3*0 + 1*3 = 3 points
Team 4: 3*0 + 1*1 = 1 point

So team 2 has the most number of points, 14. The method should thus return 14.


1)
{12,45,20,17,48,0}
{48,10,53,94,0,100}

Returns: 145

Both team 1 and team 3 got 145 points, which is the maximum.

2)
{35,0}
{0,76}

Returns: 105

3)
{0,0,0,0}
{0,0,0,0}

Returns: 0

4)
{13,79,26,73,14,89,71,37,89,71,19,59,39}
{88,27,5,70,84,94,20,50,2,11,31,22,50}

Returns: 361
