We have a sequence of integers. We want to remove duplicate elements from it.
You will be given a vector <int> sequence. For each element that occurs more than once leave only its rightmost occurrence. All unique elements must be copied without changes.


DEFINITION
Class:SimpleDuplicateRemover
Method:process
Parameters:vector <int>
Returns:vector <int>
Method signature:vector <int> process(vector <int> sequence)


CONSTRAINTS
-sequence will have between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive. 
-Each element of sequence will be between 1 and 1000, inclusive. 


EXAMPLES

0)
{1,5,5,1,6,1}

Returns: {5, 6, 1 }

We left the third 1, the second 2 and the only 6.

{2,4,2,4,4}

Returns: {2, 4 }

2)
{6,6,6,6,6,6}

Returns: {6 }

3)
{1,2,3,4,2,2,3}

Returns: {1, 4, 2, 3 }

4)
{100,100,100,99,99,99,100,100,100}

Returns: {99, 100 }
