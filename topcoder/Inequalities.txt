PROBLEM STATEMENT
You're given a set of inequalities. Each of the inequalities refers to the variable X. Determine the maximum subset of the given set which has a solution.

To make your task easier, the inequalities in the given set are always reduced to one of the following five forms:

	X < C
	X <= C
	X = C
	X > C
	X >= C

Here, C indicates some non-negative integer constant.

The inequalities are given in the vector <string> inequalities, where each element is a single inequality formatted as shown above. Return the maximal number of inequalities of the set which can be satisfied simultaneously.

DEFINITION
Class:Inequalities
Method:maximumSubset
Parameters:vector <string>
Returns:int
Method signature:int maximumSubset(vector <string> inequalities)


NOTES
-Note that X doesn't have to be an integer or positive number.


CONSTRAINTS
-inequalities will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of inequalities will be formatted "X <E> <C>", where 'X' is uppercase, <E> is one of "<", "<=", "=", ">=" or ">", and <C> is an integer between 0 and 1000, inclusive, with no extra leading zeroes (all quotes for clarity).
-No two elements of inequalities will be equal.


EXAMPLES

0)
{"X <= 12","X = 13","X > 9","X < 10","X >= 14"}

Returns: 3

Any value between 9 and 10 will satisfy the first, third and fourth inequalities.

1)
{"X < 0","X <= 0"}

Returns: 2

The solution to the whole set is any negative number.

2)
{"X = 1","X = 2","X = 3","X > 0"}

Returns: 2

Obviously, you can choose no more than one equality in addition to the fourth inequality.

3)
{"X <= 521","X >= 521","X = 521","X > 902","X > 12","X <= 1000"}

Returns: 5

The best choice is number 521.
