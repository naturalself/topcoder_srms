PROBLEM STATEMENT
Bob and Doug have recently moved from Canada to the United States, and they are confused by this strange letter, "ZEE". They need your assistance. Given a string text, replace every occurrence of the word, "ZEE", with the word, "ZED", and return the result.


Note that if "ZEE" is just part of a larger word (for example, "ZEES"), it should not be altered.
