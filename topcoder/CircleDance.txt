PROBLEM STATEMENT
Given a group of dancers' heights, arrange a circle formation that minimizes the maximum height difference between each pair of neighboring dancers.
Write a class CircleDance with a method arrangeDancers that takes a vector <int>, heights, and returns the maximum height difference between neighboring dancers.

DEFINITION
Class:CircleDance
Method:arrangeDancers
Parameters:vector <int>
Returns:int
Method signature:int arrangeDancers(vector <int> heights)


CONSTRAINTS
-heights will contain between 3 and 20 elements inclusive.
-Each element of heights will be between 150 and 210 inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
{180,183,178,185}

Returns: 5

The dancers may be arranged in a circle like this:

    180
   /   \
185     178
   \   /
    183

Their height differences are shown below:

    180
(5)/   \(2)
185     178
(2)\   /(5)
    183

The maximum difference is 5.
Other arrangements may not lead to an optimal solution. For example, the following one has a maximum difference of 7:

    180
(3)/   \(2)
183     178
(2)\   /(7)
    185


1)
{170,180,190}

Returns: 20

Any arrangement is equivalent to the following one:

     180
 (10)/ \(10)
  170 - 190
    (20)

So the result is 20. 

2)
{180,180,180,180,180}

Returns: 0

3)
{184,165,175,186,192,200,176,192,194,168,205,201}

Returns: 10
