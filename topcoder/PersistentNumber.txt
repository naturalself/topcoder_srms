PROBLEM STATEMENT
Given a number x, we can define p(x) as the product of the digits of x.  We can then form a sequence x, p(x), p(p(x))...  The persistence of x is then defined as the index (0-based) of the first single digit number in the sequence.  For example, using 99, we get the sequence 99, 9*9 = 81, 8*1 = 8.  Thus, the persistence of 99 is 2.  You will be given n, and you must return its persistence.

EXAMPLES

0)
99

Returns: 2

The example from the problem statement.

1)
268

Returns: 4

The sequence here is 268, 96, 54, 20, 0.

2)
6

Returns: 0

6 is already a single-digit number.
