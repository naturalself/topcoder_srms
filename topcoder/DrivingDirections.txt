PROBLEM STATEMENT
Simple driving directions usually consist of a list of instructions to turn in a particular direction on specific roads.  Having used such directions to drive from home to your friend's house, you want to reverse them so you can get back home.  Write a class DrivingDirections with a method reverse that takes a vector <string> directions and returns a vector <string> with the reversed directions.

directions will have at least one element.  The first will begin with "Start on " (quotes are for clarity).  Each element after the first will begin with either "Turn LEFT on " or "Turn RIGHT on ".  Note the single trailing space on each of these prefixes.  Assume the remaining characters of each element are properly formatted street names composed of alphanumeric, hyphen, and space characters; do not modify them when reversing the directions.  The returned vector <string> should be formatted the same way, with the directions reversed.  For example, if the directions are:

Start on Pirate Street
Turn LEFT on Viking Avenue
Turn RIGHT on Ninja Court

The reversed directions would be:

Start on Ninja Court
Turn LEFT on Viking Avenue
Turn RIGHT on Pirate Street


DEFINITION
Class:DrivingDirections
Method:reverse
Parameters:vector <string>
Returns:vector <string>
Method signature:vector <string> reverse(vector <string> directions)


CONSTRAINTS
-directions will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-The first element of directions will begin with "Start on " (quotes are for clarity) and contain between 10 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-All other elements of directions will begin with either "Turn LEFT on " or "Turn RIGHT on ", contain at least one character following the prefix, and contain at most 50 characters.

EXAMPLES

0)
{"Start on Pirate Street",
"Turn LEFT on Viking Avenue",
"Turn RIGHT on Ninja Court"}

Returns: { "Start on Ninja Court",  "Turn LEFT on Viking Avenue",  "Turn RIGHT on Pirate Street" }

This is the example from the problem statement.

1)
{"Start on planet Earth"}

Returns: { "Start on planet Earth" }

Since there is only one instruction, the reversed directions are identical to the original.

"Turn LEFT on I-84",
"Turn LEFT on I-81",
"Turn RIGHT on I-80",

"Turn RIGHT on Mission Blvd",
"Turn LEFT on I-880",
"Turn RIGHT on Montague Expressway",
"Turn RIGHT on Mission College Blvd"}

Returns: { "Start on Mission College Blvd",  
	   "Turn LEFT on Montague Expressway",  
	   "Turn LEFT on I-880",
