PROBLEM STATEMENT
You will be given a vector <string>, conflicts, where each element represents a single player in a multiplayer game.  Element i represents player i, and character j of element i represents whether player i will win ('W'), tie ('T'), or lose ('L') against player j. 
Your task is to ensure that each player wins against at least p% of the other players, and loses against at least q% of the other players.  You should return the 0-based index of the first player in the input (lowest index) that does not meet these requirements, or -1 if all players meet them.  Note that if there are N players total, then at least ceil((N-1)*p/100) of the characters in element i must be 'W' for player i to meet the requirements.  The formula for losses is analogous.


DEFINITION
Class:BalancedGame
Method:result
Parameters:vector <string>, int, int
Returns:int
Method signature:int result(vector <string> conflicts, int p, int q)


NOTES
-The i-th character of the i-th element of conflicts will always be 'T' and can be ignored.
-The function 'ceil' in ceil((N-1)*p/100) returns the least integer greater than or equal to its argument. For example, ceil(1.5)=2 and ceil(4)=4.


CONSTRAINTS
-p and q will be between 0 and 100, inclusive.
-conflicts will have between 2 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-Each element of conflicts will have the same number of characters ('W', 'L' and 'T') as the number of elements in conflicts.
-If the j-th character of the i-th element of conflicts is 'W', 'L', or 'T' then the i-th character of the j-th element will be 'L', 'W' or 'T' respectively.
-The i-th character of the i-th element of conflicts will always by 'T'.


EXAMPLES

0)
{"TWWW",
 "LTWW",
 "LLTW",
 "LLLT"}
20
20

Returns: 0

Player 0 cannot lose and player 3 cannot win, so these players are not balanced. Return the lowest index of an unbalanced player.

1)
{"TWWW",
 "LTWW",
 "LLTW",
 "LLLT"}
0
0

Returns: -1

Now there are no balancing constraints, so even though player 0 cannot lose and player 3 cannot win, the characters are balanced.

2)
{"TTT",
 "TTT",
 "TTT"}
1
1

Returns: 0

Even with such lax balancing constraints, a perfectly matched set of characters is not balanced in the sense we are looking for.

3)

 "WTTWTTLLWLLWWLTLWW",
 "WTTWWTLWTWLWWWWLTW",
