PROBLEM STATEMENT
The cows in Byterland are mooing loudly, annoying the residents very much.  Mrs. Darcy of the villa Pemberley is planning to resolve this problem by allowing only one cow to moo.  She will pick the cow whose mooing is the least offensive to all the other cows.

The farmland in Pemberley is divided into n*m squares of grassland.  Each square is either empty or occupied by a single cow.  When a cow at (x,y) moos, the dissatisfaction of a cow at (i,j) is equal to the square of the distance between them: ((x-i)2 + (y-j)2).  The total dissatisfaction is the sum of the dissatisfaction of all the cows.

Return the minimal total dissatisfaction that can be achieved by allowing only a single cow to moo.  The farmland will be given as a vector <string>, where '.' characters denote empty squares, and 'C' characters denote squares occupied by cows.
