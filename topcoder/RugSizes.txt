PROBLEM STATEMENT

Rugs come in various sizes. In fact, we can find a rug with any integer width
and length, except that no rugs have a distinct width and length that are both even integers. For example, we can find a 4x4 rug, but not a 2x4 rug.  We want to know how many different choices we have for a
given area.

Create a class RugSizes the contains a method rugCount that is given the desired
area and returns the number of different ways in which we can choose a rug size that
will cover that exact area.
Do not count the same size twice -- a 6 x 9 rug and a 9 x 6 rug should be 
counted as one choice.



DEFINITION
Class:RugSizes
Method:rugCount
Parameters:int
Returns:int
Method signature:int rugCount(int area)


CONSTRAINTS
-area will be between 1 and 100,000, inclusive.


EXAMPLES

0)
4

Returns: 2



   The choices are 1 x 4 (or equivalently 4 x 1) and 2 x 2.



1)
8

Returns: 1

 

   Only 1 x 8 is available. Note that 2 x 4 has the desired area, but is not
   available since its width and length differ and are both even numbers.
