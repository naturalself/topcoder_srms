PROBLEM STATEMENT

Due to historical reasons people measure temperature in different scales, such as Fahrenheit and Celsius. Your task is to convert a temperature from one scale to another. It is known that both scales are linear with respect to each other (i.e., 
there are real numbers a and b such that temperature t presented in the first scale can be converted to the second by the law t'=a*t+b).


You are given 5 ints: f1, the freezing point of water in the first scale; b1, the boiling point of water in the first scale; f2, the freezing point of water in the second scale; b2, the boiling point of water in the second scale; and t, the temperature in the first scale. Return t converted into the second scale.


DEFINITION
Class:TemperatureScales
Method:convert
Parameters:int, int, int, int, int
Returns:double
Method signature:double convert(int f1, int b1, int f2, int b2, int t)


NOTES
-The return value must be within 1e-9 absolute or relative error of the actual result.
-Because the boiling and the freezing points of water depend on the atmospheric pressure, you may assume that both the scales are under the same circumstances.


CONSTRAINTS
-f1,b1,f2,b2 and t will each be between -1000 and 1000, inclusive.
-f1 will be less than b1.
-f2 will be less than b2.

These are two identical scales, so temperatures in both of them coincide.
