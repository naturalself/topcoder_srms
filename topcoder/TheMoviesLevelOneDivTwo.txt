PROBLEM STATEMENT
John and Brus are going to a theater to see a very interesting movie.  They would like to have seats next to each other in the same row.  The theater contains n rows, with m seats in each row.  Rows are numbered 1 to n from front to back, and seats are numbered 1 to m from left to right.  Some of the seats are already reserved, but John and Brus can book any of the available seats.

You are given vector <int>s row and seat.  The i-th elements of row and seat are the row number and seat number of the i-th reserved seat.  All remaining seats are available.  Return the number of ways for John and Brus to book two available seats next to each other in the same row.
