PROBLEM STATEMENT
In this problem, you will simulate a program that controls the actions of a progress indicator. The indicator is a single bar character in the middle of the screen with one of 4 states: '|', '-', '\', and '/'. The program is given as a sequence of instructions in the form:
<instr> <secs>
where <instr> represents one of 4 possible actions, and <secs> is the action's duration in seconds. The action is performed once each second. The 4 possible actions are::
'L': Spin left.  If the bar is in state '|', it goes to '\'.  State '\' goes to '-', '-' goes to '/', and '/' goes to '|'.
'R': Spin right.  This is the exact opposite of 'L': '\' goes to '|', '|' goes to '/', '/' goes to '-', and '-' goes to '\'.
'S': Stay.  The bar remains in its current state.
'F': Flip.  The bar is rotated 90 degrees: '\' becomes '/', '/' becomes '\', '-' becomes '|', and '|' becomes '-'.
So, the sequence "F03L02" and the starting state of '-' leads to the following sequence: "-|-|\-".
You are given a program and a startState. Return a string containing the sequence of states produced by the program. The ith character of the string is the state of the progress indicator after i seconds. At time 0, the indicator is in its initial state, so the first character of the return value is always startState.

DEFINITION
Class:IndicatorMotion
Method:getMotion
Parameters:string, char
Returns:string
Method signature:string getMotion(string program, char startState)


NOTES
-In the examples the character '\' appears as '\\' because of the C++/Java syntax for escaping characters.


CONSTRAINTS
-startState will be '|', '-', '\' or '/'.
-program will contain exactly 3*k characters, where k is an integer between 0 and 10, inclusive.
-For each k, the (3*k)-th character in program will be one of 'L', 'R', 'F' or 'S'.
-For each k, the (3*k+1)-th and (3*k+2)-th characters of program will be digits ('0'-'9').


EXAMPLES

0)
"F03L02R03S02F04"
'-'

Returns: "-|-|\\-\\|///\\/\\/"

This leads to the following sequence of states (below each state is the action performed during that second):
-|-|\-\|///\/\/
.FFFLLRRRSSFFFF


1)
"F10R01F10"
'/'

Returns: "/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/-|-|-|-|-|-"

2)
""
'/'

Returns: "/"

Watch out for empty programs!

3)
"F00R00L00S00"
'\\'

Returns: "\\"

And "empty" programs.
