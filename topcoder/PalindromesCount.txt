PROBLEM STATEMENT
A palindrome is a string that is the same whether it is read from left to right or from right to left. Little Dazdraperma likes 
palindromes a lot. As a birthday gift she received two strings A and B. Now she is curious if there is a 
way to insert string B into string A so that the resulting string is a palindrome. You agreed to help her and 
even tell how many different variants of such insertions exist. Two variants are considered different if 
string B is inserted in different places. Return the number of possible insertion variants.


For example, let A="aba" and  B="b". You can insert B in 4 different places:
Before the first letter of A. The result is "baba" and it is not a palindrome.
After the first letter 'a'. The result is "abba" and it is a palindrome.
After the letter 'b'. The result is "abba" and it is also a palindrome.
After the second letter 'a'. The result is "abab" and it is not a palindrome.

So, the answer for this example is 2.

DEFINITION
Class:PalindromesCount
Method:count
Parameters:string, string
Returns:int
Method signature:int count(string A, string B)


CONSTRAINTS
-A and B will each contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-Each character of A and B will be a lowercase letter ('a'-'z').


EXAMPLES

0)
"aba"
"b"

Returns: 2

The example from the problem statement.

1)
"aa"
"a"

Returns: 3

Here every possible insertion point gives you a palindrome.

2)
"aca"
"bb"

Returns: 0

No possible solutions.

3)
"abba"
"abba"

Returns: 3

4)
"topcoder"
"coder"

Returns: 0
