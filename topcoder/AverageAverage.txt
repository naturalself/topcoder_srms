PROBLEM STATEMENT
Given a vector <int> numList, for each non-empty subset of numList, compute the average of its elements, then return the average of those averages.


DEFINITION
Class:AverageAverage
Method:average
Parameters:vector <int>
Returns:double
Method signature:double average(vector <int> numList)


NOTES
-The returned value must have an absolute or relative error less than 1e-9.


CONSTRAINTS
-numList will contain between 1 and 8 elements, inclusive.
-All elements of numList will be between -1000 and 1000, inclusive.
-All elements of numList will be distinct.


EXAMPLES

0)
{1,2,3}

Returns: 2.0

The non-empty subsets of numList are: {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {2,3}, and {1,2,3}, whose respective averages are: 1, 2, 3, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 2.  The average of the averages is 2.

1)
{42}

Returns: 42.0

There is only one non-empty subset to consider.

2)
{3,1,4,15,9}

Returns: 6.4
