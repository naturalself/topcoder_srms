PROBLEM STATEMENT
A letter-string is composed of letters ('A'-'Z','a'-'z') and dashes ('-').  The
length of a letter-string is the number of characters in it not including dashes
(in other words, the number of letters in the string).  Given a list of
letter-strings you will return the sum of their lengths.

Create a class LetterStrings that contains the method sum, which takes a
vector <string>, s, and returns an int representing the sum of the lengths of
the given letter-strings.
