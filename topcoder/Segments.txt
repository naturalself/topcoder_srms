PROBLEM STATEMENT

  You are given two line segments on the plane. Each segment is parallel to either the X axis or the Y axis. Your task is to figure out how the segments intersect and return one of the following strings:

  "NO", if the segments do not intersect
  "POINT", if the segments' intersection forms a point
  "SEGMENT", if the segments' intersection forms a line segment



  The segments will be given as two int[]s s1 and s2. Each of them will contain four integers x1, y1, x2, y2 (in that order) where (x1, y1), (x2, y2) are segment endpoints.


DEFINITION
Class:Segments
Method:intersection
Parameters:vector <int>, vector <int>
Returns:string
Method signature:string intersection(vector <int> s1, vector <int> s2)


CONSTRAINTS
-       Each of s1 and s2 will contain exactly four elements
-       All integers in s1 and s2 will be between -1000 and 1000, inclusive
-       Each segment will be parallel to either the X axis or the Y axis 


EXAMPLES

0)
{0, 0, 0, 1}	
{1, 0, 1, 1}

Returns: "NO"

The segments are parallel and there is no intersection.

1)
{0, 0, 0, 1}
{0, 1, 0, 2}

Returns: "POINT"

The segments are located on the same line and have only one common point (0,1).

2)
{0, -1, 0, 1}
{-1, 0, 1, 0}

Returns: "POINT"

The segments intersect at point (0,0).

3)
{0, 0, 2, 0}
{1, 0, 10, 0}

Returns: "SEGMENT"

The segments have a common line segment from (1,0) to (2,0).

4)
{5, 5, 5, 5}
{6, 6, 6, 6}

Returns: "NO"

These are two different points.

5)
{10, 0, -10, 0}
{5, 0, -5, 0}

Returns: "SEGMENT"

The segments have a common line segment from (-5,0) to (5,0).
