PROBLEM STATEMENT


You are implementing the member registration system of an online dating
site. When a new member signs up, it is possible that she initially
chooses the same username as an existing member. The system must then
inform the new member of the conflict and suggest a variant of the chosen
name with a number attached to the end.




If an existing member is named "FunkyMonkey", for example, and
a new member wants the same username, the simplest suggestion the system
can make is "FunkyMonkey1".  If there is already a member by
that name, the system must suggest "FunkyMonkey2", unless that 
variant is also taken. If all names from "FunkyMonkey1"
through "FunkyMonkey9" are taken as well as the
original "FunkyMonkey", the system moves on to consider 
"FunkyMonkey10", and so on. The goal is to use the smallest possible
number in the variant. Note that each username consists of letters (the characters
from 'a' to 'z' and from 'A' to 'Z') and numerals ('0' to '9').




You are given a vector <string>, existingNames, containing
all usernames that have already been registered in the system. You are
also given a single string, newName, containing the
username that a new member wants to use. In the event of a conflict, this
member will accept the suggestion offered by your system in accordance
with the principles above. Return a string containing the
username finally assigned to the new member.
