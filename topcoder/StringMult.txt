PROBLEM STATEMENT
The definition of how to multiply a string by an integer follows:
The empty string ("") multiplied by any integer is the empty string ("").
For example: "" * 9 = ""
Any string multiplied by 0 is the empty string ("").
For example: "Terrific" * 0 = ""
A non-empty string S multiplied by a positive integer k is the concatenation
of k occurrences of S.
For example: "Great" * 4 = "GreatGreatGreatGreat"
A non-empty string S multiplied by a negative integer k is the concatenation
of k occurrences of the reverse of S.
For example: "Great" * -4 = "taerGtaerGtaerGtaerG"

Your method will take a string and an int and return their product.
