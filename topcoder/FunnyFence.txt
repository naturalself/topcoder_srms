PROBLEM STATEMENT
A sequence of characters is called a fence if it consists of alternating '|' and '-' characters, like "|-|-|-|" or "-|-|" (quotes for clarity only). Notice that "|-||-|" or "--" are not fences, because each contains two equal characters adjacent to each other.

Given a string s, find the longest consecutive substring of it that is a fence, and return its length.

DEFINITION
Class:FunnyFence
Method:getLength
Parameters:string
Returns:int
Method signature:int getLength(string s)


CONSTRAINTS
-s will contain between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-Each character of s will be either '|' or '-'.


EXAMPLES

0)
"|-|-|"

Returns: 5

The entire string is a fence.

1)
"-|-|-|-"

Returns: 7

Still a fence.

2)
"||||||"

Returns: 1

A fence can be just 1 character long, so every 1 character substring here is a fence.

3)
"|-||-|-"

Returns: 4

The last 4 characters form the longest consecutive substring that is a fence.

4)
"|-|---|-|---|-|"

Returns: 5

"-|-|-" right in the middle gives the longest fence.

5)
"|||-||--|--|---|-||-|-|-|--||---||-||-||-|--||"

Returns: 8
