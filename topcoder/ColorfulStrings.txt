PROBLEM STATEMENT
The product value of a string is 
the product of all the digits ('0'-'9') in the string. 
For example, the product value of "123" is 1 * 2 * 3 = 6. 
A string is called colorful if it contains only digits 
and the product value of each of its nonempty contiguous substrings is distinct. 

For example, the string "263" has six substrings: "2", "6", "3", "26", "63" and "263". 
The product values of these substrings are: 2, 6, 3, 2 * 6 = 12, 6 * 3 = 18 
and 2 * 6 * 3 = 36, respectively. 
Since all six product values are distinct, "263" is colorful. 
On the other hand, "236" is not colorful 
because two of its substrings, "6" and "23", have the same product value (6 = 2 * 3). 

Return the k-th (1-based) lexicographically smallest 
colorful string of length n. 
If there are less than k colorful strings of length n, 
return an empty string instead. 


DEFINITION
Class:ColorfulStrings
Method:getKth
Parameters:int, int
Returns:string
Method signature:string getKth(int n, int k)


NOTES
-The lexicographically smaller of two strings is the one that has the smaller character ('0' < '1' < ... < '9') at the first position where they differ. 


CONSTRAINTS
-n will be between 1 and 50, inclusive. 
-k will be between 1 and 1,000,000,000, inclusive.
